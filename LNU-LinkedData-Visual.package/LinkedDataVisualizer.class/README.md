Please comment me using the following template inspired by Class Responsibility Collaborator (CRC) design:

For the Class part:  State a one line summary. For example, "I represent a paragraph of text".
I represent a base class for visualizing a linked data structure and its operations.

For the Responsibility part: Three sentences about my main responsibilities - what I do, what I know.

I can show a unary or a binary operation on a linked data structure given the right initialization.
I know of the elements of a given data structure and the links between them.

For the Collaborators Part: State my main collaborators and one line about how I interact with them. 

I use Roassal2 and its main components like RTView, TRCanvas for displaying output.

- (for bonus points) how to create instances.

   One simple example is simply gorgeous.
